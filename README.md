# OmniAuth mixi

This gem contains the mixi strategy for OmniAuth.

mixi uses the OAuth2 server flow, you can read about it here: http://developer.mixi.co.jp/en/connect/mixi_graph_api/api_auth/

## How To Use It

So ket's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-mixi'

You can also pull them in directly from Github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth-mixi', git => 'https://github.com/yoichiro/omniauth-mixi.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :mixi, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret'
    end

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with Partner Dashboard.

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth mixi is tested under 1.9.3.
