# OmniAuth mixi

This gem contains the mixi strategy for OmniAuth.

mixi uses the OAuth2 server flow, you can read about it here: http://developer.mixi.co.jp/en/connect/mixi_graph_api/api_auth/

## How To Use It

So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-mixi'
```

You can also pull them in directly from Github e.g.:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-mixi', git => 'https://github.com/yoichiro/omniauth-mixi.git'
```

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :mixi, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret'
end
```

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with Partner Dashboard.

When you define like the Builder above, you will retrieve basic user's informations. If you want to retrieve minimum information set only, the parameter ':info_level' can be used:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :mixi, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret', :info_level => :min
end
```

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Auth Hash

Here's an example Auth Hash available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'mixi',
  :uid => '1234567',
  :info => {
    :name => 'Yoichiro Tanaka',
    :first_name => 'Yoichiro',
    :last_name => 'Tanaka',
    :description => 'I am an engineer. And, ...',
    :location => 'Hasuda-shi, Saitama pref.',
    :nickname => 'Yoichiro',
    :urls => {
      :profile => 'http://mixi.jp/show_friend.pl?uid=1234567'
    },
    :image => 'https://profile.img.mixi.jp/1234567.jpg'
  },
  credentials => {
    :token => 'ABCDEFG...', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you may wish to store
    :refresh_token => 'HIJKLMN...',
    :expires_at => 1353854879, # when the access token expires (it always will)
    :expires => true
  },
  :extra => {
    :raw_info => {
      :addresses => [{
        :region => 'Saitama pref.',
        :type => 'location',
        :locality => 'Hasuda-shi'
      }],
      :thumbnailUrl => 'https://profile.img.mixi.jp/1234567.jpg',
      :aboutMe => 'I am an engineer. And, ...',
      :name => {
        :givenName => 'Yoichiro',
        :familyName => 'Tanaka'
      },
      :id => '1234567',
      :profileUrl => 'http://mixi.jp/show_friend.pl?uid=1234567',
      :displayName => 'Yoichiro'
    }
  }
}
```

The precise information available may depend on the permissions which you request.

## How To Launch Example

This project includes an example application to try OmniAuth-mixi quickly. You can launch the example by the following commands:

    $ cd example
    $ bundle install
    $ CLIENT_ID=[consumer_key] CLIENT_SECRET=[consumer_secret] rackup

Of course, you have to replace the two parameters `[consumer_key]` and `[consumer_secret]` to them issued for your application.

And, open http://localhost:9292/ in your browser, then you will see the authentication and authorization page of mixi.

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth mixi is tested under 1.9.3.
