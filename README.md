# OmniAuth mixi

This gem contains the mixi strategy for OmniAuth.

mixi uses the OAuth2 server flow, you can read about it here: http://developer.mixi.co.jp/en/connect/mixi_graph_api/api_auth/

## How To Use It

So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-mixi'

You can also pull them in directly from Github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth-mixi', git => 'https://github.com/yoichiro/omniauth-mixi.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :mixi, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret'
    end

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with Partner Dashboard.

When you define like the Builder above, you will retrieve basic user's informations. If you want to retrieve minimum information set only, the parameter ':info_level' can be used:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :mixi, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret', :info_level => :min
    end

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## How To Launch Example

This project includes an example application to try OmniAuth-mixi quickly. You can launch the example by the following commands:

    $ cd example
    $ bundle install
    $ CLIENT_ID=[consumer_key] CLIENT_SECRET=[consumer_secret] rackup

Of course, you have to replace the two parameters `[consumer_key]` and `[consumer_secret]` to them issued for your application.

And, open http://localhost:9292/ in your browser, then you will see the authentication and authorization page of mixi.

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth mixi is tested under 1.9.3.
